# haskell-ml
This repository contains several Haskell programs for machine learning. I built them for my own learning.
## Overview
Now my Haskell code is for machine learning methods below:
- Linear regression
- Decision tree
- Neural network

Each directory contains ".hs" or ".lhs" files. You can compile ".lhs" files as both ".tex" and ".hs" files.
